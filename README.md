|            |        Flyweight        |                            eliminates the need to store all data in each object, allowing you to load more objects into a limited amount of memory by sharing the same state shared by multiple objects.                             |
|            |          Proxy          |                                                  The proxy controls access to the original object and allows some processing before and after submitting the request to the object.                                                  |

|            |          State          |                               abstracts state-related behavior into separate state classes, and letting the original object delegate work to instance of these classes instead of handling it itself.                                |
|            |        Strategy         |                                              define a series of algorithms and put each algorithm into a separate class so that the algorithm objects can be replaced with each other.                                               |
|            |     Template Method     |                                                                         Arrange algorithm steps in advance and initialize with different algorithm instances                                                                         |
